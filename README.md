## Casino
A set of classes and interfaces that you would need to implement the functionality of a generic card game, including method signatures and member variables, written in ES6. These are to illustrate class design only and do not amount to a real game.

For illustrative purposes, private data is being kept using properties whose names are marked via a prefixed underscore, with the understanding that it is not safe, and is only a guideline for client code.
  

## Getting started

Perform the following commands:

  npm install
  npm start

View the site at http://127.0.0.1:8888 after it builds.

## Deployment

Execute:

  npm run build

The site will be compiled using the alternate webpack config (webpack.production.config.js).
